                <p>One of my hobbies is playing piano. I started playing piano when I was a kid. When I was 8th grade, my parents registered me in piano course, Purwacaraka. But after 3 years I dropped my piano lesson and started focusing my study.</div>

            <div>
                <p> There are various reasons how it can benefit us from learning to play the piano.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It gives you happiness. Did you know that research has found that music brings us happiness? It is like our central to our lives. Why not give yourself a chance to learn to play the piano because music can give us an emotional and creative outlet.</li>
                    <li>Playing the music instrument is such a great source of satisfaction. I know playing the piano is hard as a beginner. However, when you finally managed to play a song at ease, it will provide you a deep sense of satisfaction. It is a great source of pleasure and fulfillment if you ask me.</li>
                    <li>You can play the piano by yourself. As for other musical instruments such as clarinet and violin which only produce one line. As a result, you will always need an accompaniment. Therefore, playing the piano can be a better option as you can play it solo that provides both melody and harmony.</li>
                    <li>It is also possible that you can make coherent sounds by playing the piano. This is because it has ready-made pitches.</li>
                    <li>You need to be coordinate to play the piano. In general, you have to learn to multi-task. I understand this can be hard but it is really good to develop our mental skills and focus. I realize that after playing the piano for more than 3 months. My mind has became a lot sharper and I can do things more efficiently.</li>
                    <li>It is proven that both children and grown-ups that are involved in musical related activities are usually happier and more sociable as compared to those who do not.</li>
