                <p>Munchlax (Japanese: ゴンベ Gonbe) is a Normal-type Baby Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It is known for its very high appetite and eats anything edible except for Pokémon and humans.</p>

                <h3>Biology</h3>
                <p>Munchlax is a teal Pokémon with a cream spot on its chest. Its round head is teal in the top half and cream on the bottom half. It has big, round eyes and large pointy ears. It has five-fingered hands and cream feet with three clawed toes. The fur close to the bottom of a Munchlax seems to resemble a dress. Munchlax has two pointy teeth that stick out of its mouth even if closed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It is a hyperactive Pokémon. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax tends to store food in its long fur, although it sometimes forgets about its hidden food. Its stomach allows it to eat nearly anything, even rotten food, and is indifferent to flavor. It can also eat many servings of food at a time without chewing, and rarely gets full. It eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax.</p>

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>Munchlax is most likely based on a baby bear. Its habits may also be based on the fact that bears eat a lot of food before hibernating, which Snorlax seems to do a lot more of. Also the fact that they are found in and around Honey Trees adds up to what they are based on, as most bears (especially black bears) love honey.</p>
                <h4>Name Origin</h4>
                <p>Munchlax is a combination of munch (to chew on food) and lax or relax.</p>
                <p>Gonbe may be a combination of Kabigon (Snorlax's Japanese name) and baby. It may also derive from 権兵衛 gonbē, popular Japanese name for peasants in the old days.</p>
